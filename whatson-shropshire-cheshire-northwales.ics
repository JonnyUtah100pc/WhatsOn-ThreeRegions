LOCATION:Close Faces We Love: A Celebration of Portraiture at VAN Gallery 10:00 - 17:00 14th September 2025 – 11th November 2025 Faces We Love: A Celebration of Portraiture at VAN Gallery A fascinating new exhibition Faces We Love is on at the Visual Art Network - VAN Gallery in Shrewsbury's Darwin Shopping Centre unto\; 11 October 2025. Faces We Love is a new exhibition exploring our timeless fascination with the human face and the features of animals through a diverse mix of artworks\, on now until 11 October at the Visual Art Network (VAN) Gallery in the Darwin Shopping Centre. From the very first cave paintings\, some 27\,000 years ago\, humans have been compelled to represent faces. Babies can recognise familiar faces from as young as two to four months\, and throughout history artists have continued to immortalise what it means to be human through portraiture. Faces We Love draws on this rich tradition\, offering both realistic and abstract interpretations that capture character\, mood\, personality and emotion. Faces We Love brings together the work of 21 artists and makers\, each rising to the challenge of representing human and animal features in 2D and 3D forms. The result is a powerful experience that celebrates individuality while reflecting our shared human instinct to connect through recognition. In addition to the main exhibition\, 29 more artists and makers are showcasing ceramics\, glass\, jewellery and textiles across the gallery\, highlighting the incredible breadth of creativity in Shropshire and beyond. Visitors will also discover five specially curated displays\, with three artists creating their own unique installations on the Artists’ Boards and two makers shaping the Makers’ Space. These personal curations offer an intimate glimpse into the creative process\, allowing visitors to engage with the work in a more direct and personal way. Run entirely by volunteer members\, VAN Gallery not only showcases exciting new work but also plays an active role in promoting and lobbying for the visual arts across Shropshire\, Telford and Wrekin. Whether you are drawn to the precision of realism\, the mystery of abstraction\, or the joy of discovering new makers\, Faces We Love offers something for everyone.

LOCATION:Close Plays for Remembrance Gerald Sibleyras Heroes translated by Tom Stoppard\, with Lions led by Donkeys &The Last Lion by Tim Baker 19:30 - 20:30 31st October 2025 Blackburn Theatre\, Prestfelde School London Road Shrewsbury \, Shropshire Sy26nz View Location Map Blackburn Theatre\, Prestfelde School As part of this years Remembrance and Armistice commemoration Bloomin' Good Productions are touring three gentle\, thoughtful comedies around Shropshire. On Friday 31st October they are at Blackburn Theatre Prestfelde School\, Shrewsbury. The evening features the Laurence Olivier Award-winning play Heroes by Gerald Sibleyras\, translated by Sir Tom Stoppard (famous for Shakespeare In Love). It's a snapshot of three eccentric WW1 veterans plotting a hopeless escape from their French retirement home. Reviewers describe the humour as being akin to The Last of the Summer Wine. This one-act play will be accompanied by two new pieces written by local writer Tim Baker. Set in God's Waiting Room\, Lions Led By Donkeys\, which references the formation of the Poppy movement\, puts Field Marshall Douglas Haig in the spotlight. Challenged over his role in the Great War can he defend his tactics which resulted in two million British Casualties. In The Last Lion we meet American Rifleman Henry Gunter. What was his unique contribution to The Great War? An enjoyable evening is promised proving comedy can be the very best way to be respectful. Tickets available from ticketsource.co.uk/heroes or on the door. More Information end .details

Virginia Kettles Rolling Folk Virginia Kettle is the very heart of the multi award-winning folk-rock band Merry Hell. Her songs\, spirit and energies have helped drive the band ever upwards\, giving a significant outlet to her creativity\, providing anthems such as Bury Me Naked\, which had 20\,000 fans swaying in a Cropredy field\, as well as irresistible dancing tunes\, and slices of wry humour as seen in ‘VIOLET’\, her solo tour-de-force during the band set\, where she often forgoes the need for amplification and wanders freely among the audience. Her solo album ‘No Place Like Tomorrow ‘was acritical and popular success\, hitting the heights of No.1 in the Amazon Folk Charts within days of its release. Rolling Folk As a prolific writer of songs\, Rolling Folk gives Virginia the chance to share a variety of songs not included in Merry Hell’s sets. It is not a replacement for the band\, but an additional outlet for her creativity and energy. Offering the same level of songwriting excellence as Merry Hell\, but a different\, more intimate feel\, plus additional musical explorations\, Rolling Folk surrounds Virginia with a fabulous and interesting selection of players\, particularly multi\, multi-instrumentalist Chris Lee\, (Full House\, Time Bandits\, Family Mahone\, Galleon Blast\, Rad Co.\, etc\, etc etc) and percussionist\, whistle player and flautist\, Mark Wooley (Ade Edmondson's Bad Shepherds\, Full House\, session master and more) and more recently ace fiddle player Clare ‘Fluff’ Smith\, again a (young) veteran of numerous projects\, including a stint with The Incredible String Band. Add in Virginia’s bandmate and husband John\, all giving breadth and depth to her musical and lyrical visions. She has been described by Folk Northwest magazine as ‘The best thing to happen in British Folk for years’ and who are we to argue? An evening not to be missed! More Information end .details

This Valentine's Singles Disco takes place at The Mercure Hotel in Telford and is a rare chance to enjoy a night out knowing everyone in the room is single and open to meeting someone new. No awkward guessing\, no mixed signals\, just a room full of potential connections. The theme is 'Devil and Angels\,' so you can go all out with a fancy dress or just add a small nod or wink to the theme. There is absolutely no pressure to dress up. Come however you feel comfortable. These discos are always relaxed\, welcoming and friendly. When you arrive\, everyone will have a name sticker\, which instantly makes chatting easier. We will start with a light introduction activity so you have an easy excuse to talk to people without it feeling forced or awkward. There will also be optional games dotted through the evening to help people mix naturally. You never have to join in if you do not want to. As with my previous singles events\, there will be a dating match card. If you fancy someone\, you can write their name down. If you both match\, I will let you know after the event. No pressure\, no embarrassment\, and you are always in control of how involved you want to be. The music will be fun\, familiar and perfect for dancing\, with plenty of opportunities to chat in between. Most people come on their own\, and most people feel a little nervous at first\, which is completely normal. Everyone settles quickly and the feedback from these discos has been consistently lovely. This event is open to single people of all ages. Tickets are limited by gender and these discos usually sell out\, so if you are thinking about it\, do not overthink it for too long. We typically have over 120 people attend these evenings! Please only buy a ticket if you are single\, and do not bring friends who are in relationships. The magic of these nights is knowing that everyone in the room is there for the same reason. If Valentine's has felt a bit daunting in the past\, this is a fun\, low-pressure and genuinely lovely way to spend it. More Information end .details

Want to find love AND have fun at the same time? Come along to this seasonal game of Good vs Sneaky! If you know the TV show Traitors or the online game Among Us\, you already get the vibe. This works in a similar way. You will be in a room with up to 29 other players. There are 15 tickets for each gender on sale. At the start of the game everyone closes their eyes. Our Games Masters will secretly select their evil players. If they tap you\, you become an Easter Chick. The Chicks are the baddies. Your mission is to quietly pick off the Bunnies one by one each night and try to outnumber them and win the night! If you do not get tapped then you are an Easter Bunny. Your job is to sniff out which cute pastel birds are up to no good and protect the meadow from being taken over. Most people have never played this face to face. If that is you\, relax. It is simple\, funny and an easy way to see who catches your eye. If someone does catch your eye you will have a dating score card where you can mark down who you would like to see again. If they also tick you then I will send you each others details within 24 hours of the event ending. You need to be within 3 years of the advertised age range to attend. Bunnies vs Chicks. Chocolate chaos. Possible romance. Happy hunting. 🐰🥚🐥 More Information end .details
