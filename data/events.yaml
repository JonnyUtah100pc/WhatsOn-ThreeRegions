    of Portraiture at VAN Gallery A fascinating new exhibition Faces We Love is on
    at the Visual Art Network - VAN Gallery in Shrewsbury''s Darwin Shopping Centre
    unto; 11 October 2025. Faces We Love is a new exhibition exploring our timeless
    fascination with the human face and the features of animals through a diverse
    mix of artworks, on now until 11 October at the Visual Art Network (VAN) Gallery
    in the Darwin Shopping Centre. From the very first cave paintings, some 27,000
    years ago, humans have been compelled to represent faces. Babies can recognise
    familiar faces from as young as two to four months, and throughout history artists
    have continued to immortalise what it means to be human through portraiture. Faces
    We Love draws on this rich tradition, offering both realistic and abstract interpretations
    that capture character, mood, personality and emotion. Faces We Love brings together
    the work of 21 artists and makers, each rising to the challenge of representing
    human and animal features in 2D and 3D forms. The result is a powerful experience
    that celebrates individuality while reflecting our shared human instinct to connect
    through recognition. In addition to the main exhibition, 29 more artists and makers
    are showcasing ceramics, glass, jewellery and textiles across the gallery, highlighting
    the incredible breadth of creativity in Shropshire and beyond. Visitors will also
    discover five specially curated displays, with three artists creating their own
    unique installations on the Artists‚Äô Boards and two makers shaping the Makers‚Äô
    Space. These personal curations offer an intimate glimpse into the creative process,
    allowing visitors to engage with the work in a more direct and personal way. Run
    entirely by volunteer members, VAN Gallery not only showcases exciting new work
    but also plays an active role in promoting and lobbying for the visual arts across
    Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin. Whether you are drawn to the precision of realism,
    the mystery of abstraction, or the joy of discovering new makers, Faces We Love
    offers something for everyone. Main picture "Broken Beauty" by Julie Goldthorpe

    THE Halloween Disco for Single People in Shropshire? There are not many places
    you can have a night out knowing everyone in the room is single and looking to
    date! Taking place at a beautiful country hotel in Shrewsbury, this is going to
    be a fun night with cheesy dance floor fillers, a DIY photo booth and the opportunity
    to match with potential dates! I can not stress this enough...please only buy
    a ticket if you are single, and don't bring friends who are in relationships.
    We want this to be a room full of opportunities for singles in Shropshire! You
    can choose to either wear Halloween-themed fancy dress or just dress fancy - there
    is never any pressure at my discos! These have been the nicest events to attend,
    based on feedback and reviews and a genuinely lovely way to meet friends and potentially
    to find love! Tickets are limited by gender, and they have sold out previously,
    so if you do fancy this, don't wait too long or negotiate with yourself! Most
    people attend on their own so this is normal AND most people are nervous (until
    they settle in). We have a matching game at the beginning of the event so you
    have an excuse to talk to anyone and everyone along with party games (which are
    optional, again no pressure). More Information end .details

    Rolling Folk Virginia Kettle is the very heart of the multi award-winning folk-rock
    band Merry Hell. Her songs, spirit and energies have helped drive the band ever
    upwards, giving a significant outlet to her creativity, providing anthems such
    as Bury Me Naked, which had 20,000 fans swaying in a Cropredy field, as well as
    irresistible dancing tunes, and slices of wry humour as seen in ‚ÄòVIOLET‚Äô, her
    solo tour-de-force during the band set, where she often forgoes the need for amplification
    and wanders freely among the audience. Her solo album ‚ÄòNo Place Like Tomorrow
    ‚Äòwas acritical and popular success, hitting the heights of No.1 in the Amazon
    Folk Charts within days of its release. Rolling Folk As a prolific writer of songs,
    Rolling Folk gives Virginia the chance to share a variety of songs not included
    in Merry Hell‚Äôs sets. It is not a replacement for the band, but an additional
    outlet for her creativity and energy. Offering the same level of songwriting excellence
    as Merry Hell, but a different, more intimate feel, plus additional musical explorations,
    Rolling Folk surrounds Virginia with a fabulous and interesting selection of players,
    particularly multi, multi-instrumentalist Chris Lee, (Full House, Time Bandits,
    Family Mahone, Galleon Blast, Rad Co., etc, etc etc) and percussionist, whistle
    player and flautist, Mark Wooley (Ade Edmondson's Bad Shepherds, Full House, session
    master and more) and more recently ace fiddle player Clare ‚ÄòFluff‚Äô Smith, again
    a (young) veteran of numerous projects, including a stint with The Incredible
    String Band. Add in Virginia‚Äôs bandmate and husband John, all giving breadth and
    depth to her musical and lyrical visions. She has been described by Folk Northwest
    magazine as ‚ÄòThe best thing to happen in British Folk for years‚Äô and who are we
    to argue? An evening not to be missed! More Information end .details

    person so if that's you, have no fear because it's very simple, very fun and a
    great chance to see if you fancy someone in person. And if you do....awesome because
    you will have a dating score card where you can let me know you wish to see them
